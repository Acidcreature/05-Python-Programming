# While Loops

While loops, just like C and C++, loop through each iteration until either the condition is met or a break statement is called. Being that this is a loop... it is possible and rather easy to get stuck in an infinite loop. 

```py
count = 0
while count < 10:
    print('count: ' + str(count))
    count += 1
```
