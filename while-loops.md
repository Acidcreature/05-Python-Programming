# While Loops

While loops, just like C and C++, loop through each iteration until either the condition is met or a break statement is called. Being that this is a loop... it is possible and rather easy to get stuck in an infinite loop.

```py
count = 0
while count < 10:
    print('count: ' + str(count))
    count += 1
```

**Output:**

```
count: 0
count: 1
count: 2
count: 3
count: 4
count: 5
count: 6
count: 7
count: 8
count: 9
```
