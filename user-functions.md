# User Functions

Python functions are blocks of reuseable code that can be called to accomplish some sort of functionality. Functions are meant to split up the code into functionally organized code that can be reused. In Python, you do not have to return a value.

To define a function use: **def function\_name\(parameters\):**

```py
def function_name(parameters):
    x = 0 # What we want to return
    
    return x # What we return
```

**With return value:**

```py
def name_upper(name):
    return name
```

**With no return value:**

```py
def name_upper(name):
    print name
```
