#### For Loops

#### For Loop in C:

```c
char *my_string = "Python";
for (int i = 0; i < strlen(my_string); i++) {
    printf(%c\n", my_string[i]);
}
```

#### Python in C Style:

```py
my_string = "Python"
for i in range(len(my_string)):
    print(my_string[i])
```

While the Python one certainly is shorter and looks cleaner... it's still not Pythonic. It's ugly and not the most readable code. 

#### For Loop... Python Style

```py
my_string = "Python"
for letter in my_string:
    print letter
```

So easy, a caveman can do it!
