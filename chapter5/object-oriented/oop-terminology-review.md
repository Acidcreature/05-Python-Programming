# OOP Terminology Review

* **Class**
* * "Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new
    _type _of object, allowing new _instances _of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods \(defined by its class\) for modifying its state."
* **Class Variable**
* * Variables defined within the class definition that belong to the class

  ```py
  class TestClass:
      i = 10
    
  print TestClass.i
  ```
* **Data Member**
* **Function Overloading**
* **Instance Variable**
* **Inheritance**
* **Instance**
* **Instantiation**
* **Method**
* **Object**
* **Operator Overloading**
