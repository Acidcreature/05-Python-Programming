# User Classes

* **Classes are used to create objects that bundle data and functionality together.**
* **Classes provide highly reusable code in a cleaner, more efficient matter.**
* **We won’t hash the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming too hard since Python and C++ OOP are very similar. But some considerations:**
* * Python is typically 5-10x shorter than C++ equivalent
  * Python programs run slower than C++ at runtime
  * There isn’t a protected, public or private keyword per-say
  * Python is better as a “glue” program or for fast implementations. Thus why we use Python in socket programing for example
