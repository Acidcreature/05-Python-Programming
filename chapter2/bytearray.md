# Bytes\(\)

It's worth re mentioning that Python 2 and Python 3 have differences when it comes to bytes and strings. 

# Bytearray\(\)

Bytearray\(\) is a mutable sequence of integers in range of 0 &lt;= x &lt; 256; available in Python 2.6 and laterâ€‹. Byte Arrays are useful when you need to modify individual bytes in a sequence.
