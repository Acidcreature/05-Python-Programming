# Sequence Objects: Lists

Lists are very similar to C arrays. Lists **are mutable and nestable**. They are not ordered! There is no variable length per say, aside from what the system itself can handle. In other words, lists are dynamically adjusted to fit their contents. Lists can be multidimensional and can contain elements of different types. You can create a list using \[\].

```py
>>> my_list = ['Hello World', 15, True, 'w']​
>>> nested_list = [['such', 'wow'], 5, [False, '15']]​
```
