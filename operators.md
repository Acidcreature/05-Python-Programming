# Bitwise and Comparison Operators

## The Ancient Bitwise Operators \(Yet really useful\)

Bitwise Operators directly manipulate bits. There really is no speed advantage to bitwise operators in Python. The main advantage of bitwise operators is for scripting, compression, encryption, communication over sockets \(checksums, stop bits, control algorithms, etc\).

#### Operators:

* x &lt;&lt; y     \#returns x left-shifted y places​

* x &gt;&gt; y     \#returns x right-shifted y places​

* x & y       \#bitwise and​

* x \| y        \#bitwise or​

* x ^ y       \#bitwisexor​

* ~x          \#returns the ones complement
