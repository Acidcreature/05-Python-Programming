# Capstone Project

For this capstone project, you and your team will be utilizing Python and Network Programming principles. You and your team can choose to build whatever you'd like; but it must be within scope of possibility. Take into consideration time, each other's skill level and the restrictions listed below. Good luck!

### Restrictions:

* Your teams will be created by the instructors and a leader will be assigned. Unlike the C project, we have a better idea of the balance of the classroom and will assign teams and leaders accordingly. 
* You should try to limit everything to Python. Importing C libraries and such is fine. But do not use a large library like Django or another language like JavaScript or Ruby. If it's something very small, it can be cleared on a case by case basis.
* Use GitLab for version control. If you'd like to use GitHub to show off your work at a later time, clear that with the squadron.

* Your project must be approved. The first day or two is for planning and coming up with a project idea. Once your team has come up with an idea, come to us with the following:

  * Team name

  * Project idea

  * Tech used

* Once again, the first day or two is for planning. White board, draw out diagrams, notes, wireframes, etc. We will be restricting most coding on day one.

* Team leader has the final say. This is how it is in the real world and it's the most effective way to prevent time loss.

### Must Use:

* Python
* BSD Sockets \(TCP/UDP\)
* Must send data over a network
* Python Classes
* Modules
* Standard Library
