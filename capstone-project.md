# Capstone Project

For this capstone project, you and your team will be utilizing Python and Network Programming principles. You and your team can choose to build whatever you'd like; but it must be within scope of possibility. Take into consideration time, each other's skill level and the restrictions listed below. Good luck!  
  


### Restrictions:

* Your teams will be created by the instructors and a leader will be assigned. Unlike the C project, we have a better idea of the balance of the classroom and will assign teams and leaders accordingly. 
* You can only use Python. Importing C libraries and such is fine. But do not use a large library like Django or another language like JavaScript or Ruby.
