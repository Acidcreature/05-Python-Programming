1. Roman NumeralsWrite a program that prompts the user to enter a number within the range of 1 through 10.
The program should display the Roman numeral version of that number. 
If the number isoutside the range of 1 through 10, the program should display an error message.

# Converts numbers 1 - 10 to Roman numerals
def RomanConvert():
    while True:
        origValue = int(input("Please enter a number between 1 and 10 "))
        while origValue > 10 or origValue < 1:
            origValue = int(input("Please enter a number between 1 and 10 "))
        if origValue == 1:
            print("This is your number as a roman numeral I")
        elif origValue == 2:
            print("This is your number as a roman numeral II")
        elif origValue == 3:
            print("This is your number as a roman numeral III")
        elif origValue == 4:
            print("This is your number as a roman numeral IV")
        elif origValue == 5:
            print("This is your number as a roman numeral V")
        elif origValue == 6:
            print("This is your number as a roman numeral VI")
        elif origValue == 7:
            print("This is your number as a roman numeral VII")
        elif origValue == 8:
            print("This is your number as a roman numeral VIII")
        elif origValue == 9:
            print("This is your number as a roman numeral IX")
        elif origValue == 10:
            print("This is your number as a roman numeral X")

2. Areas of RectanglesThe area of a rectangle is the rectangle’s length times its width. 
Write a program that asksfor the length and width of two rectangles. 
The program should tell the user which rectanglehas the greater area, or if the areas are the same. 

####################################################################
#Calulates area / compares two rectangles
def RectCalc():
    #Keep asking the user until there are no more rectangles
    while True:
        rectlen = int(input("Enter length of rectangle "))
        rectwid = int(input("Enter width of rectangle "))
        rectArea = (rectlen * rectwid)
        rectlen2 = int(input("Enter length of rectangle "))
        rectwid2 = int(input("Enter width of rectangle "))
        rectArea2 = (rectlen2 * rectwid2)
        if rectArea > rectArea2:
            print("Rectangle 1 is larger")
        elif rectArea < rectArea2:
            print("Rectangle 2 is larger")
        elif rectArea == rectArea2:
            print("They are the same size")

3. Mass and Weight Scientists measure an object’s mass in kilograms and its weight in newtons. 
If you know the amount of mass of an object in kilograms, you can calculate its weight in newtons with thefollowing formula:weight =mass * 9.8 
Write a program that asks the user to enter an object’s mass, and then calculates its weight.
If the object weighs more than 1,000 newtons, display a message indicating that it is tooheavy. 
If the object weighs less than 10 newtons, display a message indicating that it is toolight.

4. Magic DatesThe date June 10, 1960, is special because when it is written in the following format, themonth times the day equals the year:6/10/60
Design a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two digit year. 
The program should then determine whether the month times the day equals the year. If so, it should display a message saying the date is magic. 
Otherwise, it should display a message saying the date is not magic. 


5. Color MixerThe colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary colors because they cannot bemade by mixing other colors. 
When you mix two primary colors, you get a secondary color,as shown here: 
When you mix red and blue, you get purple.When you mix red and yellow, you get orange.When you mix blue and yellow, you get green.
 Design a program that prompts the user to enter the names of two primary colors to mix.
 If the user enters anything other than “red,” “blue,” or “yellow,” the program should display an error message. 
 Otherwise, the program should display the name of the secondarycolor that results. 


6. Change for a Dollar GameCreate a change-counting game that gets the user to enter the number of coins required to makeexactly one dollar. 
The program should prompt the user to enter the number of pennies,nickels, dimes, and quarters. 
If the total value of the coins entered is equal to one dollar, the program should congratulate the user for winning the game. 
Otherwise, the program should display a message indicating whether the amount entered wasmore than or less than one dollar.


7. Book Club PointsSerendipity Booksellers has a book club that awards points to its customers based on thenumber of books purchased each month.
 The points are awarded as follows:• If a customer purchases 0 books, he or she earns 0 points.• 
 If a customer purchases 1 book, he or she earns 5 points.• If a customer purchases 2 books, he or she earns 15d points.• 
 If a customer purchases 3 books, he or she earns 30 points.• If a customer purchases 4 or more books, he or she earns 60 points.
 Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of books that he or she has purchased this month and displays the number of points awarded. 


8. So)ware SalesA software company sells a package that retails for $99. Quantity discounts are givenaccording to the 
following table: Quantity Discount10–19 20–49 50–99 100 or more 20%30%40%50% 
Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of packages purchased. 
The program should then display the amountof the discount (if any) and the total amount of thepurchase after the discount. 


9. Shipping ChargesThe Fast Freight Shipping Company charges the following rates: Weight of Package        Rate per Pound2 pounds or less 
Over 2 pounds but not more than 6 pounds Over 6 pounds but not more than 10 pounds 
Over 10 pounds $1.10$2.20$3.70$3.80 
Write a program that asks the user to enter the weight of a package and then displays theshipping charges. 


10. Body Mass Index Program EnhancementIn programming Exercise #6 in Chapter 3 you were asked to write a program that calculates a person’s body mass 
index (BMI). Recall from that exercise that the BMI is often usedto determine whether a person is overweight or underweight for their height. 
A person’sBMI is calculated with the formulaBMI =weight * 703 / height2where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches. 
Enhance the program so it displays a message indicating whether the person has optimal weight, isunderweight, or is overweight. 
A person’s weight is considered to be optimal if his orher BMI is between 18.5 and 25. 
If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is consideredto be underweight. 
If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered to beoverweight.



11. Time CalculatorWrite a program that asks the user to enter a number of seconds, and works as follows:• There are 60 seconds in a minute. 
If the number of seconds entered by the user is greaterthan or equal to 60, the program should display the number of minutes in that manyseconds.•
 There are 3,600 seconds in an hour. If the number of seconds entered by the user isgreater than or equal to 3,600, the program should display 
 the number of hours in thatmany seconds.• There are 86,400 seconds in a day. 
 If the number of seconds entered by the user is greaterthan or equal to 86,400, the program should display the number of days in that manyseconds
