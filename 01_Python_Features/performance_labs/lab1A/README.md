# Lab 1A: Python Setup

---

Now that we learned the background behind Python, lets get to coding. Since Python is cross-platform, you can use whatever OS and text editor/IDE that you'd like. Below are my recommendations:

#### Recommended OS:

* Linux \(Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch, etc\)
* OS X
* Windows \(Windows is not my preferred OS for development at all. But Python works just fine on it\)

#### **Recommended editors: **

* Vim \(terminal based: steep learning curve\)
* Nano \(terminal based\)
* Visual Studio Code
* Sublime
* Atom
* Brackets

#### Recommend against:

* Visual Studio
* Eclipse
* PyCharm
* EMacs
* etc

We flat out do not need a full fledged IDE. Python is easy to understand and type. The faster you memorize it... the faster you'll be dropping scripts.
